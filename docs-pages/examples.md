\page examples Examples

This section contains various examples of 1CRM API usage.
All examples assume that an instance of [Client](@ref OneCRM::APIClient::Client)
class was created, with correct authentication.

The examples do not show usage of all models available in 1CRM,
but you can use them as patterns to write code that works with
any available model.
